# GitLab Inbox Widget

`widget.lua` publishes assigned GitLab issues and merge requests to the native inbox and supports local read state, refresh, and guarded merge-request merging.

## Requirements

Authenticate the GitLab CLI and make `glab` available through `[app.env].PATH`:

```sh
glab auth login
```

Set `GITLAB_HOST` in `[app.env]` for a self-managed or dedicated instance.

## Merge settings

```toml
[widgets.gitlab-inbox]
merge_method = "merge"
confirm_merge = false
```

Supported methods are `merge`, `squash`, and `rebase`. `merge` uses the project's configured strategy. Set `confirm_merge = true` to require a second action after the readiness check. Both settings can also be changed from the inbox source menu.

The standalone popup presentation is the `gitlab` package.
