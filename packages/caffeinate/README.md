# Caffeinate

The Caffeinate widget keeps macOS awake with the system `/usr/bin/caffeinate` command.

## Behavior

- Left-click toggles Caffeinate.
- With no widget setting, left-click starts an indefinite session.
- Right-click can start an indefinite session or a 15-minute, 30-minute, 1-hour, 2-hour, or 4-hour session.
- While Caffeinate is active, the context menu exposes a stop action.
- Indefinite sessions are renewed before EasyBar's 24-hour command timeout limit.

## Default left-click duration

Set `duration_minutes` when left-click should start a timed session instead of an indefinite one:

```toml
[widgets.caffeinate]
duration_minutes = 60
```

The value must be an integer from `1` through `1439`.

When the setting is missing, left-click uses indefinite mode. Invalid values also fall back to indefinite mode and emit a warning in the EasyBar log.

The setting affects only the left-click default. The right-click menu always keeps the indefinite option and the fixed duration presets available.

The registry package name is `caffeinate`.
