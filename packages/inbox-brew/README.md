# Homebrew Inbox Widget

`widget.lua` publishes outdated Homebrew formulae and casks to the native inbox. Source actions support refresh, `brew update`, automatic upgrades, and cancellation. Package actions can upgrade one eligible item.

## Requirements

Homebrew must be available through `[app.env].PATH`, and the native inbox must be enabled.

The widget depends on the small `brew-policy` library so packages requiring manual handling remain
visible but are not upgraded automatically. It does not depend on or activate the standalone `brew`
widget.

The standalone popup presentation is the `brew` package. Install only one Homebrew presentation unless duplicate polling is intentional.

## Configuration

Automatic checks run every 30 minutes by default. Set an interval from 5 minutes to 7 days and reload EasyBar:

```toml
[widgets.brew-inbox]
refresh_interval_minutes = 30
```

The source context menu shows the active refresh interval.
